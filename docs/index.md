# kubeapply Provider

The kubeapply provider exposes an easy way to expand, diff, and apply templated YAML resources
in a Kubernetes cluster via Terraform. It's inspired by the
[kubeapply](https://github.com/segmentio/kubeapply) tool, which enables a similar flow but
without Terraform.

Unlike other Terraform-based solutions, this provider does not require:

1. Converting manifests from YAML to HCL
2. Importing existing resources into the Terraform state
3. Creating a separate Terraform resource for each Kubernetes resource

Instead, it exposes a high-level `profile` resource that operates on arbitrary bundles of
YAML or YAML templates. Profiles can be added for existing resources in the cluster without
doing any state imports and (optionally) can be removed from Terraform without forcing
the underlying resources to be deleted.
